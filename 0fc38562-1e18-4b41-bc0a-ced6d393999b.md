@ SELECTORS

- Direct descendant
- Adjacent Sibling (h1 + p) vs general (h1 ~ p)
- Pseudo-elements
- Structural
- State

CSS selectors are the patterns used to select and style HTML elements. They range from basic tags to complex functional pseudo-classes.
Basic Selectors
 * Universal Selector (*): Matches every single element on the page.
 * Type Selector (h1, p, div): Targets elements by their HTML node name.
 * Class Selector (.className): Targets elements with a specific class attribute.
 * ID Selector (#idName): Targets a unique element with a specific id.
 * Attribute Selector ([type="text"]): Matches elements based on the presence or value of an attribute.
Combinators
 * Descendant (div p): Selects all <p> elements inside a <div>, regardless of nesting depth.
 * Child (ul > li): Selects only the direct children of a parent.
 * Adjacent Sibling (h1 + p): Selects the very next element, but only if it immediately follows the first.
 * General Sibling (h1 ~ p): Selects all siblings that follow an element, even if they aren't immediate.
Pseudo-classes
These target elements based on their state or position rather than their names.
 * State: :hover, :focus, :active, :visited.
 * Structural: :first-child, :last-child, :nth-child(n), :only-of-type.
 * Validation: :required, :invalid, :checked.
 * Negation: :not(.excludeMe) selects everything except the specified selector.
Pseudo-elements
These style specific parts of an element rather than the whole node.
 * ::before / ::after: Inserts "generated content" before or after the element's actual content.
 * ::first-letter / ::first-line: Targets the initial character or line of text.
 * ::placeholder: Styles the hint text inside input fields.
Specificity Hierarchy
When multiple selectors target the same element, the browser calculates "weight" to decide which style wins:
 * Inline styles (Highest)
 * IDs
 * Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes
 * Elements and pseudo-elements (Lowest)
Would you like me to write a specific CSS snippet demonstrating how to combine these for a complex layout?
