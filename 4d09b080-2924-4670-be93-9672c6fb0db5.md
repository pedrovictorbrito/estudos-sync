@ PYTHON SUBPROCESS

- Capture output as text
- Non-blocking process (+ capture output)
- Piping between different processes

The subprocess module is the standard tool for running external commands from within Python. It replaces older functions like os.system and os.spawn by providing more control over input, output, and error streams.
Core Functions
subprocess.run()
This is the recommended approach for most use cases. It runs a command, waits for it to finish, and returns a CompletedProcess object.
import subprocess

# Simple execution
result = subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"], capture_output=True, text=True)

# Accessing the output
print(result.stdout)

subprocess.Popen
Use this for advanced scenarios where you need non-blocking execution or complex pipe management. It creates a process object that allows you to interact with the process while it is still running.
process = subprocess.Popen(["ping", "google.com"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
# Do other work here
output, error = process.communicate()

Key Arguments
 * args: A list of strings (e.g., ["git", "commit", "-m", "fix"]). While a single string can be used with shell=True, it is generally avoided due to security risks like shell injection.
 * capture_output: When set to True, it captures stdout and stderr so they can be accessed via the returned object.
 * text: Set this to True to receive output as a string rather than bytes. This automatically handles decoding using the default system encoding.
 * check: If True, the module raises a CalledProcessError if the exit code is non-zero, which is useful for automated error handling.
 * env: Allows you to pass a dictionary of environment variables to the child process.
Piping and Streams
You can redirect the standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) to files, null devices, or back to the Python process.
# Piping the output of one command into another
p1 = subprocess.Popen(["cat", "file.txt"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
p2 = subprocess.Popen(["grep", "search_term"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
p1.stdout.close() 
output = p2.communicate()[0]

Would you like me to write a specific script that uses subprocess to automate a system task for you?
